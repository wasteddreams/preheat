# Preheat Manual Apps Whitelist
#
# List applications you want to always preload, one per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Paths must be absolute (start with /).
#
# Example:
# /usr/bin/firefox
# /usr/bin/code
# /usr/bin/burpsuite
# /usr/bin/wireshark
# /usr/bin/nmap
#
# These apps will be preloaded even if the daemon hasn't learned them yet.
# They receive highest priority for preloading.
#
# To enable, uncomment desired apps below or add your own:

# Browsers
# /usr/bin/firefox

# IDEs/Editors
# /usr/bin/code
# /usr/bin/vim
